    Hi %s! 
    This bot keeps track of my piano practice time. I connected my Kawai-ES110 to a computer via a Midi cable and wrote a simple Java application to save what keys were pressed at what time.
    This way I can calculate the practice time and potentially use this data to analyze what keys are played the most or even re-play what I played at some point in the past (this is yet to be written though). 
    Cheers!
